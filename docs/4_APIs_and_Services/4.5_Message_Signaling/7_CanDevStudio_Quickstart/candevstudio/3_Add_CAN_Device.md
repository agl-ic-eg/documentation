# Add a CAN device in CANdevStudio

Start a new project and grab a ***CanDevice*** from the left pane in the
***Device Layer*** section and drop it on the grid workspace. Right-Click on it
and open its ***Properties***. Here you have to set the ***backend*** and the
***interface*** name you'll want to use. Backend available are:

- socketcan: CAN stack present by default in the Linux Kernel. This use Linux socket and open source CAN device driver (More information here).
- systeccan: CAN bus backend using the SYS TEC CAN adapters.
- peakcan: CAN bus plugin using the PEAK CAN adapters.
- tinycan: CAN bus plugin using the MHS CAN adapters.
- vectorcan: CAN bus plugin using the Vector CAN adapters.

More details about CANdevStudio CAN bus support [here](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/qtcanbus-backends.html).

***Interface*** is the name of the device you want to use. Bring up your CAN device and use the following command to find out which one are available:

```bash
ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
