# Table assertions

* **_AFT.assertItemsEquals(actual, expected)**

    Assert that two tables contain the same items, irrespective of their keys.

    This function is practical for example if you want to compare two lists but
    where items are not in the same order:

```lua
    luaunit.assertItemsEquals( {1,2,3}, {3,2,1} ) -- assertion succeeds
```
    The comparison is not recursive on the items: if any of the items are tables,
    they are compared using table equality (like as in assertEquals() ), where the
    key matters.

```lua
    luaunit.assertItemsEquals( {1,{2,3},4}, {4,{3,2,},1} ) -- assertion fails because {2,3} ~= {3,2}
```
