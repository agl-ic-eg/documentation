Functions of class **afb_daemon**
============================

All the functions of the class **afb_daemon** use the default api.
This are internally aliased to the corresponding function of class afb_api_t.

```C
/**
 * Retrieves the common systemd's event loop of AFB
 */
struct sd_event *afb_daemon_get_event_loop();

/**
 * Retrieves the common systemd's user/session d-bus of AFB
 */
struct sd_bus *afb_daemon_get_user_bus();

/**
 * Retrieves the common systemd's system d-bus of AFB
 */
struct sd_bus *afb_daemon_get_system_bus();

/**
 * Broadcasts widely the event of 'name' with the data 'object'.
 * 'object' can be NULL.
 *
 * For convenience, the function calls 'json_object_put' for 'object'.
 * Thus, in the case where 'object' should remain available after
 * the function returns, the function 'json_object_get' shall be used.
 *
 * Calling this function is only forbidden during preinit.
 *
 * Returns the count of clients that received the event.
 */

 * See afb_event_is_valid to check if there is an error.

 * to the journal for the verbosity 'level'.
 *
 * 'file', 'line' and 'func' are indicators of position of the code in source files
 * (see macros __FILE__, __LINE__ and __func__).

 *      ERROR             3        Error conditions
 *      WARNING           4        Warning conditions
 *      NOTICE            5        Normal but significant condition
 *      INFO              6        Informational

 * in this thread (later) or in an other thread.

 * are executed in sequence in the order of there submission.
 * If 'timeout' is not 0, it represent the maximum execution time for the job in seconds.
 * At first, the job is called with 0 as signum and the given argument.
 * The job is executed with the monitoring of its time and some signals like SIGSEGV and
 * SIGFPE. When a such signal is catched, the job is terminated and reexecuted but with
 * signum being the signal number (SIGALRM when timeout expired).
 *
