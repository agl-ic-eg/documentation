# The application framework daemons

## Foreword

This document describes application framework daemons
FCS (Fully Conform to Specification) implementation is still under development.
It may happen that current implementation somehow diverges with specifications.

## Introduction

Daemons ***afm-user-daemon*** and ***afm-system-daemon*** handle applications
life.
Understand that they will manage operations like:

- ***installation***
- ***uninstallation***
- ***running***
- ***suspend***
- ***inventory***
- ...

In addition, they ensure that operations use the security framework as needed
and that applications are executed in the correct context.

***D-Bus*** is in charge of transmitting orders to the appropriate daemon
depending upon ***D-Bus*** destination.

The figure below summarizes the situation of both **afm-system-daemon** and
**afm-user-daemon** in the system.

![afm-daemons][afm-daemons]{:: style="width:65%;"}

## The D-Bus interface

### Overview of the dbus interface

The ***afm daemons*** takes theirs orders from the session instance
of D-Bus.
The use of D-Bus is great because it allows to implement
discovery and signaling.

The dbus session is by default addressed by environment
variable *DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS*. Using **systemd**
variable *DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS* is automatically set for
user sessions.

They are listening with the destination name ***org.AGL.afm.[user|system]***
at the object of path ***/org/AGL/afm/[user|system]*** on the interface
***org.AGL.afm.[user|system]***  for the below detailed members for the
***afm-system-daemon***:

- ***install***
- ***uninstall***

And for ***afm-user-daemon***:

- ***runnables***
- ***detail***
- ***start***
- ***once***
- ***terminate***
- ***pause***
- ***resume***
- ***runners***
- ***state***
- ***install***
- ***uninstall***

D-Bus is mainly used for signaling and discovery.
Its optimized typed protocol is not used except for transmitting
 only one string in both directions.

The client and the service are using JSON serialization to
exchange data.
Signature of any member of the D-Bus interface is
***string -> string*** for ***JSON -> JSON***.
This is the normal case, if there is an error, current implementation
returns a dbus error that is a string.

Here are examples using *dbus-send*, here to install an application from a
widget file:

```bash
dbus-send --session --print-reply \
    --dest=org.AGL.afm.system \
    /org/AGL/afm/system \
    org.AGL.afm.system.install 'string:"/tmp/appli.wgt"
```

And here, to query data on installed applications that can be run:

```bash
dbus-send --session --print-reply \
    --dest=org.AGL.afm.user \
    /org/AGL/afm/user \
    org.AGL.afm.user.runnables string:true
```

### The protocol over D-Bus

On all following sub-chapters we assume that we talk about either
***afm-system-daemon*** or ***afm-user-daemon***. Method and D-Bus parameters
are considered as self-explanatory.

The D-Bus interface is defined by:

- **DESTINATION**: org.AGL.afm.[user|system]
- **PATH**: /org/AGL/afm/[user|system]
- **INTERFACE**: org.AGL.afm.[user|system]

#### Method org.AGL.afm.system.install

**Description**: Install an application from a widget file.

When an application with the same *id* and *version* already exists. Outside of
using *force=true* the application is not reinstalled.

Applications are installed the subdirectories of applications common directory.
If *root* is specified, the application is installed under the
sub-directories of the *root* defined.

Note that this methods is a simple accessor method of
***org.AGL.afm.system.install*** from ***afm-system-daemon***.

After the installation and before returning to the sender,
***afm-system-daemon*** sends a signal ***org.AGL.afm.system.changed***.

**Input**: The *path* of the widget file to install and, optionally,
a flag to *force* reinstallation, and, optionally, a *root* directory.

## Starting **afm daemons**

***afm-system-daemon*** and ***afm-user-daemon*** are launched as systemd
services attached to system and user respectively.
Normally, service files are locatedat */lib/systemd/system/afm-system-daemon.service* and
*/usr/lib/systemd/user/afm-user-daemon.service*.

### ***afm-system-daemon*** options

The options for launching **afm-system-daemon** are:

```bash
    -r
    --root directory

         Set the root application directory.

         Note that the default root directory is defined
         to be /usr/share/afm/applications (may change).

    -d
    --daemon

         Daemonizes the process. It is not needed by systemd.

    -q
    --quiet

         Reduces the verbosity (can be repeated).

    -v
    --verbose

         Increases the verbosity (can be repeated).

    -h
    --help

         Prints a short help.
```

### ***afm-user-daemon*** options

The options for launching **afm-user-daemon** are:

```bash
    -a
    --application directory

         [Currently not available in the systemd version]

         Includes the given application directory to
         the database base of applications.

         Can be repeated.

    -r
    --root directory

         [Currently not available in the systemd version]

         Includes root application directory or directories when
         passing multiple rootdir to
         applications database.

         Note that default root directory for
         applications is always added. In current version
         /usr/share/afm/applications is used as default.

    -m
    --mode (local|remote)

         [Currently not available in the systemd version]

         Set the default launch mode.
         The default value is 'local'

    -d
    --daemon

         Daemonizes the process. It is not needed by systemd.

    -q
    --quiet

         Reduces the verbosity (can be repeated).

    -v
    --verbose

         Increases the verbosity (can be repeated).

    -h
    --help

         Prints a short help.
```

## Tasks of **afm-user-daemon**

### Maintaining list of applications

At start **afm-user-daemon** scans the directories containing
applications and load in memory a list of available applications
accessible by current user.

When **afm-system-daemon** installs or removes an application.
On success it sends the signal *org.AGL.afm.system.changed*.
When receiving such a signal, **afm-user-daemon** rebuilds its
applications list.

**afm-user-daemon** provides the data it collects about
applications to its clients.
Clients may either request the full list
of available applications or a more specific information about a
given application.

### Launching application

**afm-user-daemon** launches application by using systemd.
Systemd builds a secure environment for the application
before starting it.

Once launched, running instances of application receive
a runid that identify them.
To make interface with systemd evident, the pid is the runid.

### Managing instances of running applications

**afm-user-daemon** manages the list of applications
that it launched.

When owning the right permissions, a client can get the list
of running instances and details about a specific
running instance.
It can also terminate a given application.

### Installing and uninstalling applications

If the client own the right permissions,
**afm-user-daemon** delegates that task
to **afm-system-daemon**.

## Using ***afm-util***

The command line tool ***afm-util*** uses dbus-send to send
orders to **afm-user-daemon**.
This small scripts allows to send command to ***afm-user-daemon*** either
interactively at shell prompt or scriptically.

The syntax is simple:

- it accept a command and when requires attached arguments.

Here is the summary of ***afm-util***:

- **afm-util runnables      **:
  list the runnable widgets installed

- **afm-util install    wgt **:
  install the wgt file

- **afm-util uninstall  id  **:
  remove the installed widget of id

- **afm-util detail     id  **:
  print detail about the installed widget of id

- **afm-util runners        **:
  list the running instance

- **afm-util start      id  **:
  start an instance of the widget of id

- **afm-util once      id  **:
  run once an instance of the widget of id

- **afm-util terminate  rid **:
  terminate the running instance rid

- **afm-util state      rid **:
  get status of the running instance rid

Here is how to list applications using ***afm-util***:

```bash
    afm-util runnables
```
