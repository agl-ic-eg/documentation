# How to add a new documentation section into AGL documentation

They are two steps to add new markdown files to AGL documentation:

- Add a book yaml file to the repository where the documentation sources are located (written in markdown files).
- Add an entry into the global section yaml file that point to your book file. The section yaml file is in [docs-webtemplate](https://github.com/automotive-grade-linux/docs-webtemplate) repository (`git@github.com:automotive-grade-linux/docs-webtemplate.git`) named `section_<version>.yml`.

---

**Note**: To generate a local documentation please refer to the [README](https://github.com/automotive-grade-linux/docs-webtemplate/blob/master-next/README.md) of the docs-webtemplate (https://github.com/automotive-grade-linux/docs-webtemplate) and use `setupdocs.sh` script.

## Add a book yaml file into a repository

The book file is needed to describe how your documentation is structured and must be used to describe
among others :

- the global title of the doc
- the chapter name when the doc will be part of the whole documentation website
- subchapters list and consequently subchapters hierarchy
- multi-language description

---

**Note:**

Multi-language is handled by key suffixes. That is to say, there are some keys that can be suffixed by a language: ``<key>_<lang>``
For the url to the markdown files, the prefix ```%lang%``` will match with suffixes. So, you have to create a subdirectory named ```%lang%``` where the markdown files are put.

A example for the french:

```
name: "My section in english"
name_fr: "Ma section en fran√ßais"
url: "%lang/section.md"
```

```
$ ls -lR mydir
book.yml
section.md
fr/section.md
```

---

There are several types of book:

- book
- api

### Book Type

`book` type describes documentation structure and chapters.
Below the generic way to include a book file:

```yaml
type: books
books:
-
    id: <ID1>
    order: x #optional: between 0 in 100 default when not set is 50, it allows to define order in final
             #documentation, more the order number is low more the documentation is first
    title: title of your chapter  #default title
    title_<lang>: title in <lang>
    description: description of your book
    keywords: some keywords
    author: author of the documentation
    version: version of the documentation
    chapters:
        - name: Name of your subchapter
          name_<lang>: Name of your subchapter in <lang>
            url: "%lang%/relative-path/to/your/mardown.md" #%lang% will be replaced by the
                                                           #available languages,
                                                           #default language can be in the root directory
        - name: Name of your subchapter
          name_<lang>: Name of your subchapter in <lang>
          url: "%lang%/relative-path/to/your/mardown.md"
        - name: Name of your subchapter
          name_<lang>: Name of your subchapter in <lang>
            - name: Name of your subsubchapter
              name_<lang>: Name of your subsubchapter in <lang>
              url: "%lang%/relative-path/to/your/mardown.md"
            - name: Name of your subsubchapter
              name_<lang>: Name of your subsubchapter in <lang>
              children:
                - ...
            - ...
        - ...
-
    id: <ID2>
    ...
```

[book.yml.in](https://github.com/automotive-grade-linux/docs-sources/blob/master/docs/handle-docs/book.yml.in)
is a sort of schema of book.yml. This file contains all supported keys.

Here a sample yaml file, you can start from :

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automotive-grade-linux/docs-sources/master-next/docs/getting-started-book.yml -O my-new-book.yml
```

### Api Type

In progress

## Add an entry in section file

There are 4 sections in docs: getting_started, architecture_guides, developer_guides, apis_services.

They are located in `content/docs` in [docs-webtemplate](https://github.com/automotive-grade-linux/docs-webtemplate) repository.
In addition, each directory contains several section yaml file, one a version. For master version, it is `section_master.yml`.

Below the structure of section yaml file.

```yaml
url_fetch : DEFAULT_URL_FETCH #this the default url_fetch that can be overload further, there already are some default variables defined in docs-webtemplate/docs-tools
git_commit : DEFAULT_VERSION #this is the default git_commit that can be overload further, there already are some default variables defined in docs-webtemplate/docs-tools

name: Name of the section
template: generated_index.html
books:
-
    id: <ID1>
    url_fetch: <url_fetch> #optional, overload the default one
    git_commit: <git_commit> #optional, overload the default one
    path: "relativepath/from/root/repository/to/the/book/yaml/file"
    books: #optional: subbooks, will be a child of the above book
        - id: <SUBID2>
          url_fetch: <url_fetch> #optional, overload the default one
          git_commit: <git_commit> #optional, overload the default one
          path: "relativepath/from/root/repository/to/the/book/yaml/file"
        - ...
-
    id: <ID2>
    ...
```
