# Proprietary libraries for meta-rcar-gen3


The meta-rcar-gen3 layer of meta-renesas is supported Graphic GLES(GSX)
libraries, proprietary library of multimedia, and ICCOM software.

This README describes how to use these features and setting to local.conf.

```bash
    I/   Board configuration
    II/  Build with GLES
    III/ Build with Renesas multimedia libraries
    IV/  Enable Linux ICCOM driver and Linux ICCOM library
```

There are 2 main paths:

* Please check section II to config for GLES.
* Please check section III to enable Multimedia functions.

If you would like to use Linux ICCOM driver and Linux ICCOM library, please
check section IV.

**NOTE:**

* However, to have a completed local.conf, please also refer to Build
Instruction in [meta-renesas/meta-rcar-gen3/README.md](README.md).

* In addition, these libraries are not provided with recipes. If you would like
to use, you will need to get them from Renesas.

## I/ Board configuration


* Add this line to local.conf

    * For Salvator-X board

    ```bash
       MACHINE = "salvator-x"
    ```

    * For R-Car Starter Kit Premier(H3ULCB) board

    ```bash
       MACHINE = "h3ulcb"
    ```

    * For R-Car Starter Kit Pro(M3ULCB) board

    ```bash
       MACHINE = "m3ulcb"
    ```

    * For R-Car Starter Kit Pro(M3NULCB) board

    ```bash
        MACHINE = "m3nulcb"
    ```

    * For Ebisu board

    ```bash
       MACHINE = "ebisu"
    ```

* Set SOC family name

    * For H3: r8a7795

    ```bash
       SOC_FAMILY = "r8a7795"
    ```

    * For M3: r8a7796

    ```bash
       SOC_FAMILY = "r8a7796"
    ```

    * For M3N: r8a77965

    ```bash
       SOC_FAMILY = "r8a77965"
    ```

    * For E3: r8a77990

    ```bash
        # Already added in machine config: ebisu.conf
        SOC_FAMILY = "r8a77990"
    ```

## II/ Build with GLES


For wayland with GSX

* Please copy proprietary libraries to the directory of recipes.

* Set local.conf the following.

```bash
    # Enable Gfx Pkgs
    MACHINE_FEATURES_append = " gsx"
    MULTI_PROVIDER_WHITELIST += "virtual/libgl virtual/egl virtual/libgles1 virtual/libgles2"

    # for Wayland/Weston
    DISTRO_FEATURES_NATIVESDK_append = " wayland"
    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " pam"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/libgles1 = ""
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/libgles2 = "gles-user-module"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/egl = "libegl"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/libgl = ""
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/mesa = ""
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_libgbm = "libgbm"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_libgbm-dev = "libgbm"
    BBMASK = "mesa-gl"
```

* Run `bitbake core-image-weston`

## III/ Build with Renesas multimedia libraries
