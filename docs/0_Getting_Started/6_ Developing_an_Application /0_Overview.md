# Overview #

The application development workflow begins with securing the image
that runs on your hardware and finishes with debugging the application
as it runs on that hardware.

The following figure and list overview the application development
process.
You can learn about the steps in the process by reading through the
remaining sections.

**NOTE:** This procedure uses information from many other procedures
in the AGL Documentation set.
Links are provided when a set of steps is required that is documented
elsewhere.
