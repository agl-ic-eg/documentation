# Bus

We only speak about the **CAN** bus to take an example, because the different
attacks on bus like _FlewRay_, _ByteFlight_, _Most_ and _Lin_ use retro
engineering and the main argument to improve their security is to encrypt data
packets. We just describe them a bit:

- **CAN**: Controller Area Network, developed in the early 1980s, is an
  event-triggered controller network for serial communication with data rates
  up to one MBit/s. **CAN** messages are classified over their respective
  identifier. **CAN** controller broadcast their messages to all connected nodes
  and all receiving nodes decide independently if they process the message.
- **FlewRay**: Is a deterministic and error-tolerant high-speed bus. With a data
  rate up to 10 MBit/s.
- **ByteFlight**: Is used for safety-critical applications in motor vehicles
  like air-bags. Byteflight runs at 10Mbps over 2 or 3 wires plastic optical
  fibers.
- **Most**: Media Oriented System Transport, is used for transmitting audio,
  video, voice, and control data via fiber optic cables. The speed is, for the
  synchronous way, up to 24 MBit/s and asynchronous way up to 14 MBit/s.
  **MOST** messages include always a clear sender and receiver address.
- **LIN**: Local Interconnect Network, is a single-wire subnet work for
  low-cost, serial communication between smart sensors and actuators with
  typical data rates up to 20 kBit/s. It is intended to be used from the year
  2001 on everywhere in a car, where the bandwidth and versatility of a **CAN**
  network is not required.

On just about every vehicle, **ECU**s (**E**lectronic **C**ontrol **U**nits)
communicate over a CAN bus, which is a two-wire bus using hardware arbitration
for messages sent on the shared medium. This is essentially a *trusted* network
where all traffic is visible to all controllers and any controller can send any message.

A malicious **ECU** on the CAN bus can easily inject messages destined for any
other device, including things like the instrument cluster and the head unit.
There are common ways for hardware to do USB to CAN and open source software to send
and receive messages. For example, there is a driver included in the Linux kernel
that can be used to send/receive CAN signals. A malicious device on the CAN bus can
cause a great number of harmful things to happen to the system, including: sending
bogus information to other devices, sending unintended commands to ECUs,
causing DOS (Denial Of Service) on the CAN bus, etc.

# Connectors

For the connectors, we supposed that they were disabled by default. For example,
the **USB** must be disabled to avoid attacks like BadUSB. If not, configure the
Kernel to only enable the minimum require **USB** devices. The connectors used
to diagnose the car like **OBD-II** must be disabled outside garages.
