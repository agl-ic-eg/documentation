# Client Part

The client part of the X(cross) Development System (XDS) is
a set of XDS client tools that must run on your development host.

The tools that comprise the client part are: `xds-agent`, `xds-cli`, and `xds-gdb`.
Of the three, only `xds-agent`, whose source code can be found
[here](https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=src/xds/xds-agent.git)
in Gerrit is required.

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**

The binary version is also available as standard Linux packages
or as a portable Windows archive (i.e. Zip).
<!-- end-section-note -->

You should establish the following chain:

- XDS Client: (i.e. `xds-cli` or XDS Dashboard).
- XDS Agent: (`xds-agent`) running on your development host.
- XDS Server:  (`xds-server`) running on a remote server and/or in a container.

HTTP and Websocket protocols establish exchanges between these three tools.

You can change the default URL/port shown in the following illustration by using
configuration files.

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**
Installation of the XDS client tools `xds-cli` and `xds-gdb` is
optional:

- [xds-cli](https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=src/xds/xds-cli.git) : command line tool to used to interact with XDS (also used by IDE integration).
- [xds-gdb](https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=src/xds/xds-gdb.git) : requested for debugging application.

## Install Packages for Debian

Use the following commands to install packages for the client part
on Debian-based systems:

```bash
# Set DISTRO (e.g. xUbuntu_16.04, xUbuntu_16.10, xUbuntu_17.04, xUbuntu_18.04, Debian_8.0, Debian_9.0)
export DISTRO="xUbuntu_18.04"

# Set AGL_RELEASE (AGL_ElectricEel, AGL_FunkyFlounder, AGL_Master)
export AGL_RELEASE="AGL_Master"

wget -O - http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/LinuxAutomotive:/${AGL_RELEASE}/${DISTRO}/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo bash -c "cat >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/AGL.list <<EOF
deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/LinuxAutomotive:/${AGL_RELEASE}/${DISTRO}/ ./
EOF"

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install agl-xds-agent
sudo apt-get install agl-xds-cli
sudo apt-get install agl-xds-gdb
```

## Install Packages for OpenSUSE

Use the following commands to install packages for the client part
on OpenSUSE-based systems:

```bash
# Set DISTRO (openSUSE_Leap_42.3, openSUSE_Leap_15.0, openSUSE_Tumbleweed)
export DISTRO="openSUSE_Leap_15.0"

# Set AGL_RELEASE (AGL_ElectricEel, AGL_FunkyFlounder, AGL_Master)
export AGL_RELEASE="AGL_Master"

sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/LinuxAutomotive:/${AGL_RELEASE}/${DISTRO}/isv:LinuxAutomotive:${AGL_RELEASE}.repo

sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper install agl-xds-agent
sudo zypper install agl-xds-cli
sudo zypper install agl-xds-gdb
```

## Install Packages for Other Platforms (e.g. Windows / MacOS)

- Follow these steps to install `xds-agent`:

  1. Download the latest released tarball from the GitHub [Releases Page](https://github.com/iotbzh/xds-agent/releases).

  1. Unzip the tarball anywhere into your local drive (e.g. `/opt/AGL/xds` or `C:\AGL\xds`).

  1. Add binary to PATH:

      - MacOs: create the .bash_profile `nano .bash_profile` and add `export PATH="/opt/AGL/xds/xds-agent:$PATH`
      - Windows: change the system path using the control panel or system settings.
        Alternatively, you can `setx path "C:\AGK\xds\xds-agent;%path%"`

- If you want to install optional tools, repeat the previous steps for each tool:
  - `xds-cli`, which is used for command-line and IDE integration.
  Downloaded from the ([released tarball link](https://github.com/iotbzh/xds-cli/releases)).
  - `xds-gdb`, used for debugging applications.
  Downloaded from the ([released tarball link](https://github.com/iotbzh/xds-gdb/releases)).

## Start xds-agent

As noted earlier, the `xds-agent` client tool must run on your local
development host when you use XDS.
Depending on your development host, use the following commands:

- For a Linux-based development host, a user systemd service is provided
  (i.e. `xds-agent.service`).

  To start this service automatically when your host boots, enable
  the service using the following command:

  ```bash
  # Enable xds-agent service at boot
  systemctl --user enable xds-agent.service
  ```

  To start the XDS-agent service and display its log, use these
  commands:

  ```bash
  # Manually start xds-agent service
  systemctl --user start xds-agent.service

  # Get status and log of xds-agent service
  systemctl --user status xds-agent.service
  ```

- For a MacOS-based host, use the following command to
  manually start `xds-agent`:

  ```batch
  /opt/AGL/bin/xds-agent
  ```

- For a Windows-based host, use the following command to
  manually start `xds-agent`:

  ```batch
  C:\AGL\xds\xds-agent\xds-agent.exe
  ```
