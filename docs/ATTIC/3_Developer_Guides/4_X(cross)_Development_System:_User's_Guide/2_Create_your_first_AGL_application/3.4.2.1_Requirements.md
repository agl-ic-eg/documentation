# Requirements

Before you can build your application using XDS, you need to be
sure you have satisfied the requirements described in this section.

- The agent is running locally on your machine.
  For information about the agent and how to install it, see the
  "[Client Part](client-part.html)" topic.

- The server is running locally in a Docker container
  or is accessible on your network
  For information about the server and how to install it, see the
  "[Server Part](server-part.html)" topic.

- one or more Software Development Kits (SDKs) are installed.
  For information on installing an SDK, see the
  "[AGL SDKs](install-sdk.html)" or
  "[Download or Build Your SDK Installer](../../../../getting_started/reference/getting-started/app-workflow-sdk.html)"
  topics.

- Your XDS configuration is correct.
  You can test this connection between the agent and the server
  by opening the XDS Dashboard in a Web Browser and confirming
  no error messages.
  See the
  "[Check if xds-server is Running](server-part.html#check-if-xds-server-is-running)"
  topic.
