# Overview

The application development workflow using XDS begins with
making sure you have met all the
[requirements](create-app-requirements.html) needed to
use the tool.

Once requirements are met, you have some options for
[getting the application source files](create-app-get-source-files.html)
together.
These options depend on where the XDS Server part is
running and which Client Part configuration you are using
(i.e. Standalone, On-Premise, or SaaS).

You can build the application several ways:

- Use the XDS Client
  [Command Line](create-app-build-cmd-line.html)
- Use the XDS Client
  [Dashboard](create-app-build-dashboard.html)
- Use a third-party Interactive Development Environment
  ([IDE](create-app-build-ide.html)) application
  (e.g. NetBeans, Visual Studio, and so forth).

The following figure overviews the XDS application development process:
