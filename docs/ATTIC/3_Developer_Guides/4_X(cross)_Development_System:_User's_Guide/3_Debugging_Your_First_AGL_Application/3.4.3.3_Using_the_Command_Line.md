# Using the XDS Command Line

You can debug your AGL application using the XDS command line
in XDS remote mode or in native mode.

## XDS Remote Mode

XDS remote debugging is the default mode for using XDS to debug your
application.


Follow this procedure to use XDS remotely to debug your application:

1. Declare the project you want to debug to the `xds-server`.
   The project can also have been built using XDS.
   See the "[Create your first AGL application](../../../#create-your-first-agl-application)"
   topic for more details.

2. Be sure you have the XDS agent and XDS server chain in place.
   You can find more information on this chain in the
   "[Installing XDS](../../../#installing-xds)" topic.

3. Determine the unique project and SDK ID values.
   Two methods exist for you to locate these ID values:

   - Use the "Project" page of the XDS dashboard.

   - Use the `xds-gdb --list` command from the XDS command line.
     This command returns the list of all existing project and SDK
     IDs:

     ```bash
     xds-gdb --list
     ```

4. Define the `XDS_PROJECT_ID` and `XDS_SDK_ID` variables.
   Defining these variables refers the project to the
   `xds-server`.
   Once you refer the project, you are ready to use `xds-gdb`
   (e.g. cross debug your project).

5. Build and debug the project.

**Example**

Following is an example that builds and debugs a project
based on a CMakefile and the
[cmake-apps-module](https://git.automotivelinux.org/src/cmake-apps-module/):

```bash
# Go into your project directory (e.g. helloworld-native-application)
cd ~/xds-workspace
# Clone the project files into your local directory.
git clone https://github.com/iotbzh/helloworld-native-application.git
# Go to the local project's directory.
cd helloworld-service

# Declare your project on xds-server
# For now, you can only do this step using the XDS Dashboard.
# See the "Build Using the XDS Dashboard" topic in the "Create Your
# First Application" topic.

# Define XDS configuration variables by creating a "xds-config.env" file.
cat <<EOF >./xds-config.env
#optional if not default value: XDS_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:8800
XDS_PROJECT_ID=IW7B4EE-DBY4Z74_myProject
XDS_SDK_ID=poky-agl_aarch64_4.0.1
EOF

# Define the configuration file to use.
export XDS_CONFIG=../xds-gen3.conf

# Create a new build directory.
mkdir build && cd build

# Start remote cross-build
xds-cli exec -- cmake -DRSYNC_TARGET=root@myTarget ..
xds-cli exec -- make
xds-cli exec -- make remote-target-populate

# Start debugging
xds-gdb -x target/gdb-on-root@myTarget.ini
```

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**

The [helloworld-native-application](https://github.com/iotbzh/helloworld-native-application)
project is an AGL project based on the
[cmake-apps-module](https://git.automotivelinux.org/src/cmake-apps-module/).
For information on installing this module, see the
"[Installing the CMAKE Templates](../../cmakeafbtemplates/dev_guide/installing-cmake.html))"
topic.

The CMake templates that are used to develop applications
with the AGL Application Framework, automatically generate
Makefile rules (e.g. `remote-target-populate`) or scripts
(e.g. `build/target/*`).

For more info about the CMake templates, see the
"[Using the Cmake Applications Module](../../../#using-the-cmake-applications-module)"
topic.

## Native debugging

Native debugging is best for applications or services that are also
built natively and you want to use any debugger (e.g. GDB) on an actual
piece of hardware.

To enable native debugging mode, set the `XDS_NATIVE_GDB` variable.

For information on debugging with GDB, see
"[Debugging with GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb.html)".
