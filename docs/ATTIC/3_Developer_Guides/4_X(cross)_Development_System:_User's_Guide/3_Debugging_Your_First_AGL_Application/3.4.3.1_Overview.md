# Overview

Debugging your AGL application is based on the GNU Project Debugger
([GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)).
In order to use GDB, you must use `xds-gdb` as a wrapper on GDB to
cross-debug your application.
For information on `xds-gdb`, see the
"[Client Part](./client-part.html)" topic.

Using `xds-gdb` allows you to debug an application built with
XDS without the need to install GDB or any cross-tools.

XDS supports two debugging models:

* Native debugging

* XDS remote debugging

The default debugging model is XDS remote.
To use this model, you must have previously set up the XDS
agent and server so that you can cross-debug your application.
See the
"[Server Part](./server-part.html)" and
"[Client Part](./client-part.html)" topics for more
information on getting set up.

If you want to use the native debugging model, you must define the
`XDS_NATIVE_GDB` environment variable.
See the
"[Configuration](./debug-configuration.html)" topic for information
on XDS configuration variables.

The remainder of this topic describes
[configurations](./debug-configuration.html), using the XDS
[command line](./debug-cmd-line.html) to debug, and using an
[IDE](./debug-ide.html) to debug.
