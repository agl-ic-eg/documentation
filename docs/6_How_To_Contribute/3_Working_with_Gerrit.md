title: Working with Gerrit
---

Follow these instructions to collaborate on AGL through the Gerrit review
system.

Please be sure that you are subscribed to the [mailing
list](https://lists.automotivelinux.org/g/agl-dev-community) and of course, you
can reach out on IRC at the #automotive channel on Freenode.net

Gerrit assigns the following roles to users:

-  **Submitters**: May submit changes for consideration, review other code
   changes, and make recommendations for acceptance or rejection by voting +1 or
   -1, respectively.
-  **Maintainers**: May approve or reject changes based upon feedback from
   reviewers voting +2 or -2, respectively.

## Getting deeper into Gerrit

A comprehensive walk-through of Gerrit is beyond the scope of this document.
There are plenty of resources available on the Internet. A good summary can be
found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial) and [Basic Gerrit
Walkthrough for GitHub
Users](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/intro-gerrit-walkthrough-github.html).

## Working with a local clone of the repository

To work on something, whether a new feature or a bugfix:

1. Open the Gerrit [repo
   page](https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/admin/repos/).

2. Select the repository you wish to work on.

3. Open a terminal window and clone the project locally using the ``Clone with
   git hook`` URL. Be sure that ``ssh`` is also selected, as this will make
   authentication much simpler. For example, for `documentation` repository:

    ```sh
    $ git clone "ssh://<LFID>@gerrit.automotivelinux.org:29418/AGL/documentation" && scp -p -P
    29418 <LFID>@gerrit.automotivelinux.org:hooks/commit-msg "documentation/.git/hooks/"
    ```

4. Setup `user` and `email` for git config

    ```sh
     $ cd documentation
     $ git.config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
     $ git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
    ```

      **NOTE:** To only configure for a particular repository :

    ```sh
     $ cd documentation
     $ git.config user.name "Your Full Name"
     $ git config user.email "your@email.com"
    ```

5. Create a descriptively-named branch off of your cloned repository

    ```sh
     $ git checkout -b issue-nname
    ```

## Using git review

There's a **very** useful tool for working with Gerrit called
[git-review](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/git-review). This
command-line tool can automate most of the ensuing sections for you. Ofcourse,
reading the information below is also highly recommended so that you understand
what's going on behind the scenes.

```sh
# for first time use only
$ git review -s
```
If `.gitreview` is missing, add the following section to ``.git/config``, and
replace ``<LFID>`` with your LFID id.

```sh
[remote "gerrit"]
   url = ssh://<LFID>@gerrit.automotivelinux.org:29418/AGL/documentation.git
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/gerrit/*
```

Then submit your change with ``git review``.

```sh
$ cd documentation
$ git review
```

When you update your patch, you can commit with ``git commit --amend``, and then
repeat the ``git review`` command.

## Typical Review Workflow

   - New Fresh Change

      ```sh
      $ cd documentation                              # Working Repository
      $ git remote -v update                          # Updating wrt remote
      $ git checkout -b mytopicbranch origin/master   # Creating new branch
      ### CODE the CHANGES
      $ git add  <file>                               # Track the changed files
      $ git commit -s                                 # Signed Commit Message
      $ git review                                    # Submit Changes to review
      ```

   - Updating existing Gerrit Review

      ```sh
      $ cd documentation                              # Working Repository
      $ git review -d 25678                           # Download review, 25678 is change number
      ### CODE the CHANGES
      $ git add  <file>                               # Track the changed files
      $ git commit -s                                 # Signed Commit Message
      $ git review                                    # Submit Changes to review
      $ git checkout master                           # Return to master branch
      ```

## Reviewing Using Gerrit

-  **Add**: This button allows the change submitter to manually add names of
   people who should review a change; start typing a name and the system will
   auto-complete based on the list of people registered and with access to the
   system. They will be notified by email that you are requesting their input.

-  **Abandon**: This button is available to the submitter only; it allows a
   committer to abandon a change and remove it from the merge queue.

-  **Change-ID**: This ID is generated by Gerrit (or system). It becomes useful
   when the review process determines that your commit(s) have to be amended.
   You may submit a new version; and if the same Change-ID header (and value)
   are present, Gerrit will remember it and present it as another version of the
   same change.

-  **Status**: Currently, the example change is in review status, as indicated
   by “Needs Verified” in the upper-left corner. The list of Reviewers will all
   emit their opinion, voting +1 if they agree to the merge, -1 if they
   disagree. Gerrit users with a Maintainer role can agree to the merge or
   refuse it by voting +2 or -2 respectively.

Notifications are sent to the email address in your commit message's
Signed-off-by line. Visit your [Gerrit
dashboard](https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/dashboard/self), to check
the progress of your requests.

The history tab in Gerrit will show you the in-line comments and the author of
the review.
